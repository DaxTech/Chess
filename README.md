# Chess
Chess using pygame. Run the file and play against a friend or AI.<br>
The AI uses the alpha-beta pruning algorithm to make the moves, with an evaluation function that considers material balance, doubled and blocked pawns, and relative position of the pieces.

## Usage
Click on the executable `PythonChess.exe` and play!
From the command-line: `python DEMO.py` or just `DEMO.py`.
