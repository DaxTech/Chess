# Chess
Chess from scratch using pygame. Run `DEMO.py` or click the executable file (PythonChess.exe) and play against a friend or AI.
The AI uses the alpha-beta pruning algorithm to make the moves, with an evaluation function that considers material balance, doubled and blocked pawns, and relative position of the pieces.

## Usage
Click on the executable `PythonChess.exe` and play!<br>
From the command-line: `python DEMO.py` or just `DEMO.py`<br>
