# Chess
Chess from scratch using pygame. Run `DEMO.py` and play against a friend or AI.<br>
The AI uses the alpha-beta pruning algorithm to make the moves, with an evaluation function that considers material balance, doubled and blocked pawns, and relative position of the pieces.

## Usage
Run `python DEMO.py` or just `DEMO.py`<br>
